    "Different tasks require varying amounts of computational resources. By choosing the right amount of GLM tokens, you match your token balance to the specific needs of your project.",
    "To purchase GLM tokens for computing power, youâ€™ll also need to cover the blockchain transaction costs. GLM tokens are specific for computing services, and a different token is needed for transaction fees. This is why we include a small amount of MATIC tokens in our suggestions." ,
    "When buying tokens, you'll initially acquire MATIC, then convert it to GLM. The specified amount of $ ensures you get enough of both MATIC and GLM for the computing power you need.", 
    "Not sure yet? Don't worry, this isn't your final decision.The actual purchase of tokens comes in the next steps."
